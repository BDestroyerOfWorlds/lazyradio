to access the legacy mode,
```bash
cd ~/Your/Directory
./lazyradio --legacy
```
then you will receive the list of commands in your terminal

note: without the --legacy argument it will start in the GUI mode, invalid arguments will result in an "Invalid Argument"
message and you will have to launch it again.

    Commands:
        bluetooth -r    Restart bluetooth
        bluetooth -on   Turn bluetooth on
        bluetooth -off  Turn bluetooth off
        wifi -r         Restart wifi
        wifi -on        Turn wifi on
        wifi -off       Turn wifi off
        exit            exit application
